# App Development Guide

This document outlines key development steps and decisions made during the app build process.

## Feature Implementation Log

### My Schedule Screen (`MyScheduleScreen.tsx`)

**Goal:** Display staff member's schedule using `react-native-calendars` `Agenda` component.

**Steps & File Path:** `apps/mobile/src/screens/staff/MyScheduleScreen.tsx`

1.  **Initial Setup:** Implemented `Agenda` component to show bookings.
2.  **Fix Day Selection:** Modified `onDayPress` and `selected` prop to link calendar strip selection to the displayed date.
3.  **Fix Empty State:** Ensured `renderEmptyDate` correctly displays when no bookings exist for the selected date.
4.  **List Filtering:** Adjusted `items` prop to filter the list view to only show bookings for the `selected` date.
5.  **Event Dots:** Re-introduced event indicator dots for all dates with bookings by using the `markedDates` prop, separating the data source for dots from the data source for the filtered list (`items`).
6.  **UI Refinement (Knob Removal):** Hid the pull-down calendar knob using `hideKnob={true}` and `renderKnob={() => null}` to simplify the UI and bypass a bug with the week strip becoming unresponsive after interacting with the full calendar.
7.  **UI Refinement (Compactness):** Adjusted theme font sizes (`textDayHeaderFontSize`, `textDayFontSize`) and reduced padding/margins (`styles.emptyDate`, `styles.item`) to make the calendar strip and list area more compact.

### Booking Management Screen (`BookingManagementScreen.tsx`)

**Goal:** Display a paginated list of all bookings for the staff member, grouped by date and session, with navigation to session details and then client details.

**Steps & File Paths:**
*   `apps/mobile/src/screens/staff/BookingManagementScreen.tsx`
*   `apps/mobile/src/screens/staff/SessionBookingsScreen.tsx`
*   `apps/mobile/src/screens/staff/ClientDetailsScreen.tsx`
*   `apps/mobile/src/navigation/StaffTabNavigator.tsx`
*   `packages/shared-types/types.ts`

1.  **Initial Setup (Booking List):** Created `BookingManagementScreen.tsx` to fetch and display all bookings for the `userId` passed via route params (`fetchBookingsDirect`). Implemented loading, error, and empty states.
2.  **Grouping:** Used `SectionList` to group bookings first by date (descending) and then by session (`service_type`). Added date headers (`formatDate`).
3.  **Pagination:** Implemented infinite scroll. Fetches all bookings initially but only displays `BOOKINGS_PER_PAGE` (10) dates. `handleEndReached` loads the next page of dates into `visibleDates` state, triggering a re-render of `groupedSections`.
4.  **Session Details Screen:** Created `SessionBookingsScreen.tsx` to display all bookings for a specific session on a specific date. It receives `userId`, `dateKey`, and `session` via route params. Fetches all staff bookings then filters client-side.
5.  **Client Details Screen Setup:** Created `ClientDetailsScreen.tsx` to display details for a client, receiving `clientId` via route params.
6.  **Navigation Stack:**
    *   Implemented a Stack Navigator (`BookingStackNavigator`) within the "Bookings" tab in `StaffTabNavigator.tsx` using `@react-navigation/native-stack`.
    *   Screens in stack: `BookingManagementScreen` -> `SessionBookingsScreen` -> `ClientDetailsScreen`.
    *   Updated `BookingManagementScreen.tsx` to navigate to `SessionBookingsScreen` on session card press.
    *   Updated `SessionBookingsScreen.tsx` to navigate to `ClientDetailsScreen` on booking item press, passing `client_id`.
7.  **Populate Client Details:**
    *   Updated `ClientDetailsScreen.tsx` to fetch client data from the `clients` table and associated profile data (name, phone) from the `profiles` table using Supabase direct calls.
    *   Fetches associated pets from the `pets` table.
    *   Displays full client contact information and a list of their pets with details (name, breed, age, notes).
8.  **Type Update (`Pet`):** Added optional `age` (number) and `notes` (string) fields to the `Pet` type definition in `packages/shared-types/types.ts` to support displaying more pet information.
