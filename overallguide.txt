Below is an English-language outline of how your data tables and relationships might work, keeping in mind you want to:

Keep the software as simple as possible, to be able to sell it as a solution in future to other pet businesses.

Represent Locations (multiple sites), their Fields, and who’s managing them.

Handle Bookings with start/end times (for a calendar view) and show them on a map (using location data).

Organize Staff and Clients in a way that can be extended to handle roles, assignments, or routes later on.

Eventually accommodate multiple uses—like doggy daycare, bootcamps, etc.—with capacity tracking.

1. Site (Location)
Purpose: Represents each physical location, e.g., a main site or future expansion sites.

Key Fields:

id (primary key)

name (e.g., "Downtown Site", "Uptown Branch")

address (human-readable address for convenience)

is_active (boolean to mark if a site is operational)

Relationships:

One Site can have many Fields.

Example: Site #1 is your current dog park facility with three fields. If you expand in the future, you can add another site record.

2. Field
Purpose: A sub-location within a Site—e.g., “Field A,” “Field B,” or “Yoga Lawn.”

Key Fields:

id (primary key)

site_id (foreign key → Site.id)

name (e.g., "Small Dog Area", "Bootcamp Field")

capacity (how many people/dogs can safely be in this field)

field_type (if you want to categorize it: “dog daycare,” “fitness class,” “general rental,” etc.)


Relationships:

One Site → Many Fields.

One Field → Many Bookings (since multiple time slots can exist in the same field).

Example: For your three dog park fields, each might have a separate entry with its capacity. They all share the same site_id.

3. Booking
Purpose: Captures each scheduled “session” or “time slot” when the field is used (for dog daycare session, yoga class, private rental, etc.).

Key Fields:

id (primary key)

field_id (foreign key → Field.id)

start_time (date-time)

end_time (date-time)

service_type (what is this slot for? "dog daycare," "fitness," "private rental," etc.)

status (e.g., “open,” “booked,” “cancelled,” or “closed”)

max_capacity (optional if it differs from the field’s total capacity; used for a specific booking that’s capped at a smaller number)

Relationships:

A Booking belongs to exactly one Field.

Potentially, a Booking can have multiple Clients (e.g., group class) or just one (private rental) depending on your business logic. That implies:

Many-to-many: A booking might have multiple clients or dogs attached.

Example: A booking for “March 10, 9am–12pm” in Field A with a “dog daycare” service. Status changes to “booked” once a certain threshold is reached.

4. Client & Pet (If Applicable)
Client: The person who’s booking or paying for services.

id

user_id (links to your authentication system, if you’re using a BaaS or custom auth)

name, email, etc.

Pet: A dog or other animal that belongs to a Client.

id

client_id (foreign key → Client.id)

name, breed, size, etc.

Relationships:

One Client → Many Pets.

Each Booking could be linked to many Clients (and their pets), especially if group bookings are allowed. This is typically done via a join table—for instance, booking_clients.

5. Booking-Clients (Join Table)
Purpose: For group sessions, we need a table to connect one booking to multiple clients.

Key Fields:

id (primary key)

booking_id (fk → Booking.id)

client_id (fk → Client.id)

Possibly pet_id if each booking is tied to a specific pet. (Or a separate booking_pets table if one client can bring multiple pets.)

Relationships:

A Booking can have many clients; a Client can appear in many bookings → many-to-many.

6. Staff
Purpose: Represents employees or admin users who manage bookings, handle operations, or do on-site tasks.

Key Fields:

id

user_id (again, references your auth table, potentially)

name, role (admin, staff, driver, etc.)

phone_number, notes

Relationships:

Similar to clients, staff can “log in” from the web or mobile.

You might have a booking_staff join table if multiple staff members can be assigned to a single booking.

7. Payments / Transactions (Optional Initially)
Purpose: Track each payment (method, amount, booking reference, etc.).

Key Fields:

id

client_id

booking_id (if a payment is tied to a specific session)

amount, currency

status (“paid,” “refunded,” “pending”)

created_at

8. Map View Implications
Site or Field:


Your front end (Next.js or React Native) can plot those coordinates on a map component (e.g., using React Leaflet on web, or MapView in React Native).

If staff or vehicles are also tracked in real time, you’d store their lat/lng in a separate table or ephemeral state, but that might be an advanced feature.

9. Calendar View Implications
You have start_time and end_time in Booking.

On the front end, you can query all bookings for a certain timeframe and display them in a calendar interface.

If you want staff to see all future bookings at a glance, you could:

Filter by field, site, or staff assignment.

Group them by day, by location, or by staff.

Putting It All Together
High-Level ERD (in words)
Site (1–N) → Field:

Each site has one or more fields.

Field (1–N) → Booking:

Each field can have multiple bookings over time.

Booking (N–N) → Client:

Many bookings can have many clients (i.e., group sessions). Typically via a join table called booking_clients.

Client (1–N) → Pet:

One client can own multiple pets.

Staff:

Similar to clients in that they have user_id for login, but different roles/permissions.

If staff are assigned to bookings, that’s also (N–N) → a join table like booking_staff.

Payments:

Ties back to the client and (optionally) a booking.

Next Steps
Once you have this conceptual map, you can:

Create Your BaaS or Database

For example, in Supabase, make tables named sites, fields, bookings, clients, pets, booking_clients, staff, etc.

Add foreign keys, relationships, and any row-level security rules for role-based access.

Add Minimal Columns First

Keep it simple with just the absolutely necessary columns (ID, name, start_time, etc.).

Later, add details for advanced features (like staff schedules, route management, or custom constraints).

Front-End Integration

In your Next.js admin or staff view, you’ll do queries to list bookings, show them in a calendar, or place them on a map if needed.

In your React Native client app, you’ll show open bookings (like available slots) or the user’s booked sessions.

This ensures you have enough of a schema to support a calendar view (thanks to start/end times in bookings) and a map view (thanks to lat/long in sites or fields). As your needs grow—like adding payment tracking or advanced staff route assignments—these core tables should still provide a stable foundation.
